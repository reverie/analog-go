This is a prototype for a generalization of the board game Go. In this version, stones aren't restricted to the grid. In other words, you can place them at any real coordinates, instead of integer coordinates. This requires calculating the Voronoi diagram, which is kind of fun. 

The basic mechanics of the game are implemented, but not territory scoring. If you want to play it anyways, check out all the files and then run "python play_go.py". You will need to have pygame installed.

I haven't touched this code since 2007, and even then it was a hack job.
